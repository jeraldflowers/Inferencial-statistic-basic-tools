# Inferencial-statistic-basic-tools
Inferential statistics is a branch of statistics that focuses on drawing conclusions about a population from a sample. In the context of machine learning, inferential statistics is an essential tool for evaluating the validity of machine learning models and for making decisions based on the results of these models.

Inferential statistics are used to estimate population parameters and to make inferences about the probability of certain outcomes. For example, inferential statistics can be used to test hypotheses, determine the significance of differences between groups, and estimate confidence intervals for parameter values.

In machine learning, inferential statistics are used to assess the power and accuracy of models, to measure the importance of features, and to detect and address bias in data. For example, hypothesis tests can be performed to determine if the accuracy of one model is significantly higher than that of another model or if there is a significant relationship between features and labels.

Furthermore, inferential statistics are used to validate machine learning models by evaluating their generalizability. The results of the models are evaluated using separate test data sets, and inferential statistical techniques are used to assess the validity of the results and the accuracy of the predictions.

In short, inferential statistics is an important tool in the machine learning process, as it allows to assess the efficiency and accuracy of models, to measure the importance of features, and to detect and address biases in the data. This prior knowledge of the data can help ensure that models produce accurate and useful results.
